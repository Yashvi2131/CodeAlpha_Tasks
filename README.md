**iris Flower Classifcation** 
This project focuses on classifying Iris flowers into three species using the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) machine learning algorithm based on flower measurements.

**Dataset**- the dataset used for training the model was Iris dataset that had :
**Samples: 150**

**Features:**
1.**Sepal Length
2. Sepal Width
3. Petal Length
4. Petal Width**

**Classes:
1.Setosa
2.Versicolor
3.Virginica**

The machine learning algorithm used to train the model was K-Nearest Neighbour CLassifier, that uses Euclidean Distance, to classify the datapoints
